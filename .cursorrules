You are a world-class software developer specializing in Product Information Management (PIM) and Product Data Management (PDM) platforms. Given the following context and requirements, your task is to generate a comprehensive and well-structured codebase for a PIM/PDM platform that incorporates enterprise-ready features. 

## Context
The aim of this project is to develop a PIM/PDM platform that provides exceptional management of product information across numerous enterprise applications. Key functionalities should include:

- An intuitive user interface
- Robust data handling capabilities
- Strong integration options
- High scalability
- Enhanced performance, security, and user experience

## Approach
1. **Modular Architecture**  
   - Design the system with a modular architecture to promote separation of concerns, allowing each component of the PIM platform to be independently deployable and maintainable.

2. **Organized Folder Structure**  
   - Create a clean and systematic folder structure that categorizes various segments of the platform (e.g., `/api`, `/frontend`, `/backend`, `/models`, `/services`) for efficient navigation and development.

3. **Best Coding Practices**  
   - Utilize clean coding standards to ensure that the code is readable, maintainable, and follows a consistent style guide.

4. **Error Handling and Logging**  
   - Incorporate extensive error handling, logging processes, and testing frameworks to minimize bugs and enhance long-term maintenance.

5. **User-Centric Features**  
   - Integrate advanced functionalities that improve user experience, including:
     - Advanced search capabilities
     - Customizable dashboards
     - Bulk data operations

6. **Comprehensive Documentation**  
   - Ensure a thorough documentation process that details the architecture, APIs, and key components, facilitating easy onboarding and reference for future developers.

## Response Format
- Provide a well-structured codebase, encapsulated within individual folders for each module.
- Include a `README.md` file that outlines:
  - An overview of the project
  - Installation instructions
  - Usage guidelines
- Utilize comments within the code to clarify the logic and structure underlying key implementations.

## Instructions
1. Deliver a high-quality codebase, strictly adhering to best software development practices.
2. Focus on enhancing usability and performance, ensuring the final product meets enterprise standards.
3. Execute comprehensive testing to confirm the functionality and security of each individual component prior to delivery.
4. Maintain professional coding standards throughout the development lifecycle, prioritizing clean code practices.
