# Car Images Directory

This directory should contain car images to be used for product uploads.

To download real images, you need an Unsplash API access key:
1. Get an API key from https://unsplash.com/developers
2. Set it as an environment variable: `export UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your_key_here`
3. Run the image_manager.py script: `python image_manager.py --download`

Alternatively, place your car images in this directory manually, naming them car_1.jpg, car_2.jpg, etc.
