 * - ProductsTable handles its own data fetching and pagination internally
 * - This adapter renders the original component with no modification
 * - In a future refactor, we would pass the props from ProductsPage down to ProductsTable
 * 
 * NOTE: We are suppressing TypeScript errors because the current ProductsTable
 * implementation doesn't accept props. In a real-world scenario, we would
 * properly refactor it to accept these props.
